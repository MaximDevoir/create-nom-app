Create Nom App is a monolithic repository. That means all the source code for
packages like `create-nom-app` and `nom-scripts`, the end-to-end tests, and the
documentation you are reading now, share one big repository. This design makes
it easier for people like you to contribute your changes to the project.

The Contributors Documentation will help you with:

* ensuring you have the prerequisites for development
* understanding the design structure of the project
* the Docker services we use
